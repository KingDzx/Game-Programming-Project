To play run the GameViewer class!

This game is an RPG style dungeon crawler with elements and inspirations from Pokemon, League of Legends and more!

When starting the game, use the console to enter the class you want and your name, from there, make your way as far down the dungeon as you can! Be careful of enemies along the way....
